# World Crop Data Analysis
Python code to extract data from world crops website and perform exploratory analysis.

## **Problem Statement** 
Scrape data from World Crop Database website and perform analysis on the same.

## **Proposed Solution** 

**Scrape webpages** - using Beautiful Soup.

**Create data fame** - of data extracted using pandas dataframes

**Presenting EDA** - Choropleth and Matplotlib

## The chosen domain and Seed sources:  

The domain chosen for analysis is ***World Crops***  

**Data seed** - https://world-crops.com/ 

## **Sources:** 

**Seed source:** https://world-crops.com/ 

**Supplementary sources:**  https://blog.ciat.cgiar.org/origin-of-crops/ 

## **Observations/ Insights and Analysis on the data collected :** 

1. The Middle East, North Africa, and Asia have a higher density of crop origins - https://abcdefxyz123.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/crop-plot.html

2. While most crops (65% of all crops with pollination information) have only one type of pollination, several crops (32%) have two types of pollination methods. 

3. Almost all crops belong to multiple categories, and most crops belong to 3 or 4 categories. 

4. On average, the English language contains the most variants of names for crops, compared to Dutch, Spanish, French, and German. 

5. Of all the crops with cropping pattern data (90 crops), we find that 71 belong to only one category and 19 crops to two categories. 

6. The most frequently occurring genus, family, and order in the dataset correspond to those of the most economically important crops and most important food crops. 

## **Strategy to enhance the data with crowd sourcing methods:** 

Primary points of data crowd sourcing could be farmers and traders from local mandis and crop markets, international traders in agricultural commodities and businesses in the food, beverage and restaurant industry.  

The crowd sourcing methods used for data collection could be Targeted survey, shared spreadsheet, innovation contests, crowd voting and crowd ideation can be deployed.
